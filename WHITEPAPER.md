## 2. Creator-as-Competitor Model

### 2.1 Revolutionary Pool Creation Mechanism

Traditional prediction markets suffer from centralized house-edge models. PulsePicksAI eliminates this by making **pool creators active participants** who must compete with their own strategies.

#### Pool Creation Flow:
1. **Creator Investment**: Provides initial liquidity (e.g., 100 BETmain)
2. **Strategy Submission**: Creator submits their own trading strategy
3. **Pool Deployment**: Creates BET{ID} tokens and AMM pair
4. **Open Competition**: Other players join with their strategies
5. **Fair Settlement**: Creator competes on equal terms

### 2.2 Economic Incentive Alignment

```solidity
// Pool Creator Economics
struct CreatorIncentives {
    uint256 baseCreationFee;     // 5% of total pool (infrastructure reward)
    uint256 competitionStake;    // Creator's investment amount
    uint256 strategyScore;       // AI evaluation of creator's strategy
    uint256 confidenceWeight;    // Investment × AI Score
}

function calculateCreatorReward(CreatorIncentives memory creator) 
    returns (uint256 totalReward) {
    
    uint256 infrastructureFee = totalPool * 0.05;  // Fixed 5%
    uint256 competitionReward = (creator.confidenceWeight / totalConfidenceWeight) 
                               * competitionPool;
    
    return infrastructureFee + competitionReward;
}
```

## 3. Confidence-Weighted Reward Mathematics

### 3.1 The Confidence Factor Innovation

Traditional betting systems only consider prediction accuracy. PulsePicksAI introduces **investment amount as confidence signal**, creating a sophisticated risk-reward matrix.

#### Mathematical Foundation:

**Confidence Weight (CW)** = Investment Amount × AI Performance Score

**Individual Reward** = (Player CW / Total CW) × Competition Pool

### 3.2 Detailed Reward Calculation Example

**Competition Setup:**
- Pool Creator: 100 BETmain investment, 0.5 AI score
- Player A: 10 BETmain investment, 0.8 AI score (#1 leaderboard)
- Player B: 20 BETmain investment, 0.7 AI score (#2 leaderboard)  
- Player C: 15 BETmain investment, 0.6 AI score (#3 leaderboard)

**Step 1: Calculate Confidence Weights**
```
Creator CW = 100 × 0.5 = 50.0
Player A CW = 10 × 0.8 = 8.0
Player B CW = 20 × 0.7 = 14.0  
Player C CW = 15 × 0.6 = 9.0
Total CW = 81.0
```

**Step 2: Distribute Rewards**
```
Total Pool = 145 BETmain
Infrastructure Fee = 145 × 0.05 = 7.25 BETmain (to creator)
Competition Pool = 137.75 BETmain

Creator Reward = (50.0/81.0) × 137.75 + 7.25 = 92.2 BETmain
Player A Reward = (8.0/81.0) × 137.75 = 13.6 BETmain  
Player B Reward = (14.0/81.0) × 137.75 = 23.8 BETmain
Player C Reward = (9.0/81.0) × 137.75 = 15.3 BETmain
```

**Outcome Analysis:**
- **Player A**: Highest skill (0.8) but low confidence (10 investment) = moderate profit (+3.6)
- **Player B**: Good skill (0.7) + medium confidence (20 investment) = good profit (+3.8)
- **Creator**: Low skill (0.5) despite high confidence (100 investment) = loss (-7.8)

## 4. Advanced AMM Pool Mechanics

### 4.1 Dynamic Pricing Model

PulsePicksAI implements enhanced Uniswap V2 constant product formula with competition-specific optimizations:

**Base Formula**: x × y = k

**Enhanced Competition Formula**:
```
k_effective = k_base × (1 + participation_bonus + creator_multiplier)

where:
- participation_bonus = min(0.1, player_count / 20)
- creator_multiplier = 0.05 (for creator participation incentive)
```

### 4.2 Swap Price Impact Calculation

```solidity
function getSwapOutput(uint256 amountIn, uint256 reserveIn, uint256 reserveOut) 
    pure returns (uint256 amountOut) {
    
    uint256 amountInWithFee = amountIn * 997;  // 0.3% fee
    uint256 numerator = amountInWithFee * reserveOut;
    uint256 denominator = (reserveIn * 1000) + amountInWithFee;
    
    amountOut = numerator / denominator;
}
```

### 4.3 Liquidity Provider Incentives

**LP Fee Structure:**
- **Base Trading Fee**: 0.3% per swap
- **Creator Bonus**: Additional 0.1% if pool creator provides >50% liquidity
- **Volume Multiplier**: +0.05% for pools with >1000 BETmain volume

## 5. AI Strategy Evaluation Engine

### 5.1 Multi-Dimensional Scoring Algorithm

The AI engine evaluates submitted strategies across multiple performance vectors:

#### Core Metrics:
1. **ROI Potential**: Expected return calculation
2. **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted returns  
3. **Maximum Drawdown**: Worst-case scenario analysis
4. **Innovation Score**: Strategy uniqueness assessment
5. **Market Timing**: Entry/exit signal quality

#### Mathematical Scoring Function:
```python
def calculate_ai_score(strategy_metrics):
    weights = {
        'roi': 0.25,
        'sharpe': 0.20, 
        'max_drawdown': 0.20,
        'innovation': 0.15,
        'timing': 0.20
    }
    
    normalized_score = sum(
        weights[metric] * normalize(value, metric_range[metric])
        for metric, value in strategy_metrics.items()
    )
    
    confidence_interval = calculate_confidence(strategy_complexity, data_quality)
    
    return {
        'score': normalized_score,
        'confidence': confidence_interval,
        'breakdown': strategy_metrics
    }
```

### 5.2 Confidence Interval Mathematics

**Statistical Confidence Calculation:**
```
Confidence = 1 - (strategy_complexity_penalty + data_uncertainty)

where:
- strategy_complexity_penalty = min(0.1, complexity_score / 10)
- data_uncertainty = historical_variance / expected_accuracy
```

## 6. Cross-Chain Integration Architecture

### 6.1 Hybrid Bridge Protocol

PulsePicksAI implements a sophisticated dual-bridge system:

**Native Avalanche Chains** (Fuji ↔ Dispatch):
- **Interchain Messaging (ICM)**: Strategy submission and result distribution
- **Interchain Token Transfer (ICTT)**: BETmain and BET{ID} token movement
- **Cost**: ~$0.01-0.05 per transaction
- **Speed**: 2-5 seconds finality

**External Chains** (Sepolia → Fuji):
- **Chainlink CCIP**: Asset bridging for external participants  
- **Cost**: ~$3-5 per cross-chain transaction
- **Speed**: 10-20 minutes settlement

### 6.2 Cross-Chain Message Structure

```solidity
struct CrossChainStrategy {
    address player;
    uint256 investment;
    string strategyText;
    bytes32 sourceChain;
    uint256 timestamp;
    bytes32 messageId;
}

struct CrossChainReward {
    address recipient;
    uint256 amount;
    bytes32 destinationChain;
    uint256 competitionId;
}
```

## 7. Economic Model & Token Mechanics

### 7.1 BETmain Token Economics

**Token Properties:**
- **Total Supply**: Dynamic, based on cross-chain deposits
- **Backing**: 1:1 with deposited assets (USDC, ETH, AVAX)
- **Utility**: Universal trading pair for all competition pools
- **Burn Mechanism**: BET{ID} tokens burned after settlement

**Supply Management:**
```solidity
contract BETmainSupply {
    mapping(bytes32 => uint256) public chainDeposits;
    uint256 public totalBackedSupply;
    
    function mintFromDeposit(bytes32 chain, uint256 amount) external {
        chainDeposits[chain] += amount;
        totalBackedSupply += amount;
        _mint(treasury, amount);
    }
    
    function burnOnWithdrawal(bytes32 chain, uint256 amount) external {
        chainDeposits[chain] -= amount;
        totalBackedSupply -= amount;
        _burn(treasury, amount);
    }
}
```

### 7.2 Competition Token Lifecycle

**BET{ID} Token Flow:**
1. **Creation**: Minted when pool created
2. **Distribution**: Sold via AMM to participants  
3. **Trading**: Active trading during competition phase
4. **Settlement**: Burned/redeemed based on performance
5. **Cleanup**: All tokens become worthless post-settlement

    require(block.timestamp > competitions[poolId].endTime, "Too early");
    
    // Atomic settlement to prevent manipulation
    _settleCompetition(poolId);
    competitions[poolId].settled = true;
}
```

### 10.2 Economic Attack Vectors
